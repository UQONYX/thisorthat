This or that? A social media site and a business tool. 

This is one of the cooler web games that I made to demonstrate my skill in Node.js, Express, jQuery, and overall design fundamentals in Bootstrap, HTML5, etc.

From a growth perspective, at its peek, the site was getting 50K clicks per month with no advertising from me. 

I also had to use a bit of python scripting to scrape tweets off of Donald Trump's twitter. 

All of this is hosted as an Azure Web App, so I learned a lot about cloud hosting and services along the way. I still (kind of!) maintain it intermitently.

If you see any funny Twilio code in there, that's because of a class that I was holding. I already bought the domain and server space for the app, so I just added a snippet for a simple text message service for the other app that I was building.
